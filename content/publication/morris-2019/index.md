abstract: "Children do not learn language from passive observation of the world, but\
  \ from interaction with caregivers who want to communicate with them. These communicative\
  \ exchanges are structured at multiple levels in ways that support support language\
  \ learning. We argue this pedagogically supportive structure can result from pressure\
  \ to communicate successfully with a linguistically immature partner. We first characterize\
  \ one kind of pedagogically supportive structure in a corpus analysis: caregivers\
  \ provide more information-rich referential communication, using both gesture and\
  \ speech to refer to a single object, when that object is rare and when their child\
  \ is young. Then, in an iterated reference game experiment on Mechanical Turk (n\
  \ = 480), we show how this behavior can arise from pressure to communicate successfully\
  \ with a less knowledgeable partner. Lastly, we show that speaker behavior in our\
  \ experiment can be explained by a rational planning model, without any explicit\
  \ teaching goal. We suggest that caregivers' desire to communicate successfully\
  \ may play a powerful role in structuring children's input in order to support language\
  \ learning"
