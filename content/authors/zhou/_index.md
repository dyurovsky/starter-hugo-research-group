Dan was an undergrad computer science major at Carnegie Mellon before completing a PhD in Cognitive Psychology at Indiana University and doing a postdoc in Psych Department at Stanford. He is broadly interested in how we learn from the people around us, and especially how children learn language. Dan is excited about understanding communication and learning from a systems perspective.
